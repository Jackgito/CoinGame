In penny game, there are six coin piles of different sizes.
The first player is chosen by random.
On each turn, a player must take at least one penny from one of the piles.
For example: If you wanted to remove 1 coin from the 2nd. pile, you would write "1-2".
The game continues with the next player taking their turn.
If a player takes the last penny from the last pile, they lose the game.

There are three difficultues to choose from. Easy chooses randomly, normal spots winning patterns and hard also avoids losing patterns.
